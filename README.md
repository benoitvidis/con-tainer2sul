# Con-tainer2sul

Con-tainer2sul automatically registers and deregisters nodes for any Docker container.

This project is inspired by [gliderlabs registrator](https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator).

The main difference is that Con-tainer2sul will by default register the containers as nodes. This allows to register a container without having to expose any network service on the host.
